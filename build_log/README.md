## Build Logs

The `/build_logs/` directory contains the logs generated by Jenkins for each build run. These logs will be named based on the date of the build, e.g., `build_2025-02-24.log`.

Each log file contains detailed information about the build process, including:

- Build start and end times
- Build steps executed
- Build status (success or failure)
- Error messages (if any)

## Prediction Results

The `/prediction_results/` directory stores JSON files containing the results of error predictions based on historical build data. These results can help predict future build failures and take preventative actions.

Example file: `build_error_predictions_2025-02-24.json`

## Model Data

The `/model_data/` directory stores machine learning model files and training data. If error prediction uses a machine learning model, it will be saved here.

Example files:
- `model_2025-02-24.pkl` - A serialized machine learning model used for error prediction
- `training_data.csv` - Training data used to build the machine learning model

## Notes

- **Log Files**: Log files are generated automatically during each build by Jenkins. They should not be manually edited.
- **Error Prediction**: If error prediction is enabled, the prediction results will be saved as JSON files in the `prediction_results/` folder.
- **Model Data**: If machine learning models are used for error prediction, they will be stored in the `model_data/` folder. New models should be trained and added here as needed.
